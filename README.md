<h1 align="center">EdgeTech-Audio-Recorder</h1>

  <p align="center">
    This repo builds upon the <a href="https://github.com/IQTLabs/edgetech-core">IQT Labs Edgetech-Core</a> functionality to instantiate an <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.mosquitto">MQTT</a> client that uses <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/arecord">arecord</a> and <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html">ffmpeg</a> to record and compress audio into `.flac` files. Functionalty is also included to respond to a <a href="https://github.com/IQTLabs/edgetech-c2">Command and Control</a> module to cycle to the next file. All of this functionality is wrapped in a Docker container for cross-platform compatability.

### Built With

[![Python][Python]][Python-url]
[![Poetry][Poetry]][Poetry-url]
[![Docker][Docker]][Docker-url]

## Getting Started

To run this repo, simply run:

```
docker-compose up
```

The audio recorder is containerized and dependencies are managed using [poetry]("https://python-poetry.org"). 

### Prerequisites

Running this repo requires that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed. 

## Usage

Spinning up this system requires an MQTT server and this container to be included in your `docker-compose.yml`. You can find an example of this workflow in this repository's `docker-compose.yml`. Additionally, some editing of relevant enviornment variables will be required based upon your system's configuration of topics to subscribe to and MQTT configuration. Examples of these enviornment variables can be found in this repository's `.env` file. 

As this system is meant to be spun up with MQTT topics you would like to write to files, copying the audio recorder `docker-compose` statements into a master `docker-compose.yml` and  `.env` files with your entire system of containers is the preferred workflow. Find an application architecture diagram example of how the usage of this module was envisioned below.
